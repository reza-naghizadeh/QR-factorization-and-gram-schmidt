# QR factorization and gram schmidt
 This MATLAB script performs QR factorization on a potentially rank-deficient matrix, identifies linearly dependent columns, extracts them to form a new matrix, and applies the Gram-Schmidt process to compute an orthonormal basis, displaying the results and visualizing the original and orthonormalized vectors.
